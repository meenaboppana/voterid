		<h1>The Ballot's In: The Impact of Voter ID Laws on Voter Turnout and Registration</h1>

        <div class="main" id="about" role="main">
		
		<h2> About This Project </h2>
		<p> Our project examines the impact voter ID laws have on voter registration and turnout within the United States. In particular, we look at 
		impacts across different demographic groups in different states. Using our data, we then create and test a predictive model to estimate the effects of stricter voter ID laws on voter turnout in future elections in certain states.
    	        </p>
		
		
		
	
    	        <h3> Types of Voter ID Laws </h3>
    	        <p>
    	        It turns out not all voter id laws are created equal. A standard division splits these laws into two groups: "non-strict laws" have provisions that sometimes allow voters without identification to cast ballots 
		while "strict laws" require all voters to present ID within a certain timeframe. We scoured the internet to find information on when states implemented these laws. 
		Note that our model does not capture differences in photo ID versus non-photo ID requirements (each of these types can also be either strict or non-strict). Currently, 
		20 states have no voter ID laws, 22 states have non-strict laws, and 9 states have strict laws. Voter ID laws have been on an upwards trend; no state has, as of today, successfully transitioned from a stricter to a less strict system.

		      <h2> Why It Matters </h2>
   	              <p>
    	              Over the past decade, the implementation of voter identification laws has become increasingly more prevalent -- and more controversial. The 2014 US midterm elections 
		      and recent changes in voter ID legislation bring particular relevance to this issue. Thought supporters claim that such laws 
		      protect the voting process, many opponents say they decrease voter turnout, especially among minority groups. However, there has been an absence of conclusive studies on this phenomenon.  
		      Our project aims to shed some insight on this question through exploratory data analysis.

    		<h2> How We Did It </h2>
    		<p>
    		Our project had one major goal: to investigate the relationship between voter turnout 
		and the existence of voter ID laws on a state-wide level. 
		We started with the hypothesis that voter ID laws might impact members of various ethnic groups differently. 
		We began our analysis by looking at historical turnout data for November elections from 2002 to 2012. 
    		</p>
    		<h3> Data </h3>
        <p>
        We drew our data on voter registration and turnout from US Census data broken down by state, year, ethnicity, and other factors. This data was available for elections between 2002 and 2012, for a total of 6 election years. 

        Determining voter ID law status on a state by state level required us to draw from several separate data sources, as it was 
	necessary to know the exact description of the law for our strictness classification as well as the exact date of 
	enactment to determine which elections were affected.

        To check for sources of bias, we also ultimately looked at the margin of victory in each state in the years tested -- we have 
	only examined this for presidential election years, however. 
        </p>

        <h2> Results </h2>
        <h3> Voter laws and turnout by state and race </h3>
    		<p>
    		We looked at the effect of voter ID laws implemented between 2002 and 2012 for all 50 states. Our visualizations 
		for the effects on voter turnout can be seen for each state below.
		In the plots, a vertical green line represents the first election when a non-strict law was in effect, while a vertical 
		black line represents the first year when a strict law was in effect. At first glance, it does not seem 
		like there was a significant change in voter registration or turnout following the introduction of the new laws. Some 
		trends do become immediately apparent from the visualizations, however, such as the fact 
		that voter registration for blacks, hispanics, and asians is generally lower than that for whites. This may partially 
		be explained by the fact that we are looking at percentage of the total population for each demographic group, not just 
		of citizens, but is nonetheless significant. To see some states that did seem to show a negative effect on turnout, check out 
		Dakota and Montana!

        <h3> Voter turnout by race </h3>
        <p> To explore this further, we also created the following table which shows voter turnout percentages across different racial groups and different years. 
          <p class="centeredImage">
		   <img src="pics/table.jpg" >
      </p>
	
	
    		<h3> Competitiveness </h3>
   		 <p> One of the confounding effects we investigated was whether a race in any particular state was more competitive 
		than any other. For example, a very close race would be likely to increase voter turnout, regardless of other factors. 
		Thus, we also found information on how competitive elections typically are in various states. More competitive elections 
		can increase turnout, independent of voter ID laws. It appears that having strict voter ID laws means a state is more 
		likely to have a competitive election (margin of victory within 10 percent). In averages, states with strict voter ID 
		laws are more likely to have elections with small margins of victory than states with nonstrict laws or no laws at all. 
		Also, as a group they are more likely to have slightly lower turnout. Similarly, states with nonstrict laws have more 
		competitive elections than those without any type of voter ID laws. However, their voter turnout tends to be more comparable 
		to that of states without voter ID laws. In terms of trends, over the past three presidential elections the margin of victory 
		has increased for every subgroup except those without voter ID laws. Additionally, voter turnout has stayed constant or decreased 
		for every subgroup. However, these results are likely caused by some combination of 1) variability between certain elections (an exciting 2008 
		election, for example) and 2) states changing their voter ID law status.  We visualize the relationship between margin of victory and  
		total turnout here:

		<h2> Predictive Model </h2>
      		<p>
    		Using a method called difference-in-differences, we were able to predict the average deviation in voter turnout
		 from the average after a state implements a strict or non strict voter ID law.  We found that in most cases
		voter turnout does tend to decrease slightly after a law is implemented.

    		<h2> Predicting Outcomes in North Dakota, Mississippi, and Texas </h2>
    		<p> We used our model to predict voter turnout in North Dakota, Mississippi, and Texas 2014 elections, 
		all three of which have recently implemented voter ID laws in the past 2 years.  We compared our predictions to actual 
		turnout data.   While overall turnout data has been released, turnout data for each ethnic group has not, so we were not able 
		to compare those results with our predictions.  In Mississippi and Texas, we were within 2 percentage points using this analysis alone, 
		though our prediction was off for North Dakota.  (We note that North Dakota was also an outlier in this year's election cycle, with the second to highest voter turnout rate.)

  <div class="main" id="further" role="main">
    <h2> Further Research </h2>
          <p>  A future direction of our research would be to test our model's predictive power of turnout by ethnic group, rather than overall turnout alone. We would be interested to compare our predictions for turnout by ethnic group in North Dakota, Mississippi, and Texas with real data as soon as it becomes available.
          </p>
          <p> Additionally, we hope to integrate the competitiveness of a state into our predictive model for voter turnout. This would help account for inter-state differences and predict future elections more accurately. </p>
          <p> A final further direction would be to perform a similar analysis of the effect of voter turnout on other demographics, especially age groups. This would require the exact same statistical methods with some more data wrangling (which we began to do). Other interesting demographics would be to look at gender differences, as well as socioeconomic status.   </p>
